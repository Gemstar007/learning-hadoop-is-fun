## Task list 
 A non exhaustive , informal task list to keep track of investigations/learnings that we should be able to do. Every investigation should ideally end up in a simple .md file which others can view and learn from. 
 

### Hadoop technologies
- [x] [Ruchi] Hive 
- [x] [Jeremy] Map Reduce in python 
- [x] [Ruchi] Spark 
- [x] [Ruchi] HBase
- [ ] [Sankalp] Sqoop 
- [ ] [Sankalp] Flume
- [x] [Sankalp] Converting tables to parquet(or avro ) 
 - done outside of hadoop 

### Developer Friendly scenarios
- [ ] Create an easy workflow for devs to interact with hadoop, most likely by using eclipse ide.

### ImageNet Data Scenarios 
- [x] [Shazia] Image organiztion using HBase and Hive 
 -  This is conceptually done we now need to create an E2E flow.
- [ ] Getting the data into Hadoop 
- [ ] ImageNet Structure , strategy to come up with primary keys , creating Image indexes 
- [x] [Ruchi] transforming images using external libraries (openCV, Imagemagick , leptonica ...) 
 -  Ruchi Used OpenCV outside hadoop, next steps are to do it in hadoop


### Hadoop management scenarios
- [x] [Sankalp] Hello world sandbox 
- [x] [Sankalp] Creating Creating a linux (ubuntu ?) vm on your PC via commandline.
- [x] [Sankalp] Creating a linux (ubuntu ?) vm in azure via commandline 
- [x] [Sankalp] deployment using ambari blueprints 
- [ ] [Sankalp] define and document the steps to create a a single machine cluster.
- [ ] define a build system for our processes
- [ ] azure data to be accessible in hadoop 
- [ ] credential management in hadoop 

### ML Technologies
- [ ] Apache Mahout on hadoop 
- [ ] h20 on hadoop 
- [ ] ML on GPU ( CNTK , tensor flow, keras ...)

### ML Learnings ( Learnings )  
- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Neural networks
- [ ] Bayesian reasoning
